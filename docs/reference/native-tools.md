# Target Tools Reference

GSV exposes one targetable tool interface to AI processes. The same tool names are used for the native cloud target, connected devices, active browser clients, and adapter command targets; the `target` argument chooses where the syscall runs.

This is the important rule for agents: choose `target: "gsv"` for Gateway-native work, and choose a device target only when the file, command, network, or hardware dependency lives on that device.

## Targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `gsv` | Native Gateway target running in the Cloudflare Worker sandbox. |
| `<deviceId>` | A connected native device, such as `macbook` or `server`. |
| `browser:<id>` | An active web shell desktop target. |
| `adapter:<adapter>:<account>` | An adapter command target, such as WhatsApp or Discord. |

The prompt includes a compact sample of accessible online targets. Use `targets list` in the native shell for paginated discovery, or `targets show <target-id>` for details. The lower-level syscall surface is still `sys.device.list`/`sys.device.get`, and device-like entries also appear in the native filesystem under `/sys/devices`.

## Agent-Visible Tools

| Tool | Syscall | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Read` | `fs.read` | Read a file or list a directory. |
| `Write` | `fs.write` | Write a complete file, creating parents where supported. |
| `Edit` | `fs.edit` | Replace exact text in a file. |
| `Delete` | `fs.delete` | Delete a file or directory. |
| `Search` | `fs.search` | Search file contents. |
| `Shell` | `shell.exec` | Execute a shell command. |
| `CodeMode` | `codemode.exec` | Run a sandboxed JavaScript block that can call filesystem and shell tools programmatically. |

Each tool receives the same public argument shape regardless of target. For example:

```json
{
  "target": "gsv",
  "path": "/sys/devices"
}
```

```json
{
  "target": "macbook",
  "input": "git status --short",
  "cwd": "~/projects/gsv"
}
```

`Shell` uses one small public argument shape:

```ts
type ShellArgs = {
  target?: string;
  cwd?: string;
  input: string;
  sessionId?: string;
};
```

When `sessionId` is absent, `input` is a command to start. When
`sessionId` is present, `input` is stdin for that running command; use
`input: ""` to poll for more output without writing stdin. The runtime owns
the wait budget and output caps, so callers should handle both completed and
running results.

## Target Descriptors

Native devices register with the Gateway as driver connections. Browser clients and adapter accounts are normalized into the same target descriptor model. A descriptor records identity, online state, and implemented syscall patterns.

```json
{
  "deviceId": "macbook",
  "description": "Personal MacBook I use for everything",
  "platform": "darwin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "online": true,
  "implements": ["fs.*", "shell.exec"]
}
```

The `implements` field is the hardware contract. The Gateway uses it to decide which devices can receive a given routed syscall. The `description` field is owner-managed context for users and processes; it is not supplied by the driver connection.

Inspect descriptors with:

- `targets list`
- `targets show <target-id>`
- `sys.device.list`
- `sys.device.get`
- `sys.device.update` to change the owner-managed `description`
- `Read` with `target: "gsv"` and `path: "/sys/devices"`

## Native `gsv` Target

The `gsv` target runs inside the Gateway. Filesystem syscalls use `GsvFs`; shell syscalls use the native `just-bash` driver.

Important native paths:

- `/home` and the user's home directory contain durable user context.
- `/workspaces` contains task workspaces and user artifacts.
- `/etc` contains operator docs and system manuals.
- `/sys` exposes live kernel configuration, devices, users, and capabilities.
- `/proc` exposes process inspection surfaces.
- `/dev` exposes device-like virtual endpoints.

Native shell commands run in the Worker sandbox. They are useful for GSV control-plane work, virtual filesystem inspection, package commands, and HTTP/network operations allowed by the runtime. They do not run on the user's laptop.

Use `skills list`, `skills search <query>`, and `skills show <skill>` in the
native shell to inspect reusable process workflows populated from layered
`skills.d` directories.

The native shell also includes a `codemode` command for reusable GSV tool
scripts and an `mcp` command for connected MCP servers:

```bash
codemode ./check.js --target macbook --cwd ~/projects/gsv --json
codemode run ./check.js --target macbook --cwd ~/projects/gsv --json
codemode -e 'return await shell("pwd")'
mcp status
mcp tools Linear
mcp describe Linear list_issues
mcp codemode
mcp call Linear list_issues --args-json '{"assignee":"me","limit":5}' --json
```

Process and automation control also stay on the native shell surface:

```bash
proc profiles
proc spawn --profile task --label "docs audit"
proc call <pid> --timeout 60s "Summarize the current result."
sched add --name daily-brief --cron "0 9 * * *" --timezone Europe/Amsterdam --profile cron "Prepare the daily brief."
```

Use `proc profiles` to discover system, user, and package-backed worker
profiles. User-defined profiles are directories under `~/profiles.d/{name}`;
profile prompt files live in `~/profiles.d/{name}/context.d/*.md`. Root-level
files can be carried by the profile, but are not loaded as prompt context.
`proc call` is the bounded request/reply path; `proc spawn --prompt` and `proc
send` are fire-and-forget unless the worker explicitly sends a later message.
Use `sched add` without `--pid` for scheduled worker processes; with `--pid`, it
delivers a process event to an existing process conversation.

Scripts use the same CodeMode shape exposed to agents. A script is treated as
the body of an async function: top-level `await` works, and the final value must
be returned explicitly.

```js
const file = await fs.read({ path: "package.json" });
const result = await lookup_record({ query: "gsv" });
return { argv, args, bytes: file.content.length, result };
```

`--target` and `--cwd` become defaults for in-script `shell(...)` and `fs.*`
calls. Positional values after `--` are available as `argv`; `--arg key=value`
and `--args-json` populate `args`.

Without `--json`, `codemode` prints only the returned value. With `--json`, it
prints the full `{ status, result?, error?, logs? }` envelope. Failed runs exit
with code `1`.

Shell calls inside CodeMode return the same result shape as direct `Shell` tool
calls. Long-running commands must be resumed with `sessionId`:

```js
let res = await shell("npm run test", { target: "macbook", cwd: "~/projects/gsv" });
let output = res.output;

while (res.status === "running") {
  res = await shell("", { sessionId: res.sessionId });
  output += res.output;
}

if (res.status === "failed") {
  throw new Error(`${res.error}\n${output}`);
}

return { exitCode: res.exitCode, output };
```

MCP tools inside CodeMode are generated as async functions from the connected
server schemas. A unique tool such as `lookup-record` becomes
`lookup_record(args)`; each tool also gets a server-qualified alias such as
`Search_lookup_record(args)` for clarity and collision handling. The CodeMode
tool description includes generated TypeScript declarations for ready MCP tools
when their schemas are known. The `mcpTools` array lists the generated function
names, server ids, original tool names, input schemas, and output schemas.
Generated functions unwrap MCP result envelopes: structured content is returned
directly, text-only content is parsed as JSON when possible or returned as a
string, and MCP tool errors throw. Server management remains available from the
native shell as `mcp status`, `mcp tools`, `mcp describe`, `mcp search`,
`mcp codemode`, `mcp refresh`, and `mcp call`. The shell command accepts either
server ids or unique server names, and tool selectors may use either the
original MCP tool name or the generated CodeMode function name.

## CLI Device Targets

CLI devices run on user machines through `gsv device run` or the managed device service. They implement the same `fs.*` and `shell.exec` interface over WebSocket.

Device filesystem semantics:

- Relative paths resolve against the configured device workspace.
- Absolute paths are used as-is on the device.
- Returned paths are local machine paths.
- Reads can return text, directory listings, or supported image content.

Device shell semantics:

- Unix devices run commands through the user's shell with `-lc`.
- Windows devices run commands through PowerShell.
- `input` starts a command; `cwd` selects its working directory.
- Long-running commands return a resumable `sessionId` instead of holding the original route open.
- `Shell` with `sessionId` and `input: ""` polls for more output.
- `Shell` with `sessionId` and non-empty `input` writes stdin, then returns new output.

Use a device target for local source trees, private networks, machine-local credentials, OS packages, hardware access, or commands that must run on that machine.

## Routing

For `fs.*` and `shell.exec`, the Gateway reads `target` at dispatch time.

- `target: "gsv"` runs the native handler.
- `target: "<deviceId>"` verifies access, online state, and `implements`, then forwards the same syscall to the device.
- `shell.exec` with `sessionId` routes through the persisted shell session owner; `target` is not required for continuation.
- `target` is removed before native execution or device forwarding, so implementations receive the same syscall-specific arguments.

Other syscall domains such as `proc.*`, `pkg.*`, `repo.*`, `sys.*`, `notification.*`, `signal.*`, and `adapter.*` are kernel/control-plane interfaces and are not hardware-routed.

`CodeMode` is process-local. It is not device-routed itself; code running inside
the sandbox calls `shell(...)` and `fs.*(...)`, and those nested calls use the
same `target` and `sessionId` routing rules as the direct `Shell`, `Read`,
`Write`, `Edit`, `Delete`, and `Search` tools.
