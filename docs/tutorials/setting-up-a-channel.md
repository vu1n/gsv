# Connecting Adapters

Adapters let external systems talk to GSV processes. This tutorial connects
WhatsApp or Discord from the Web Desktop. Use this flow first; the CLI commands
are mainly useful for automation and recovery.

This assumes you completed [Getting Started with GSV](getting-started.md) and
can open the Desktop in your browser.

## 1. Open the Adapter UI

The Desktop is made of package apps. Open **GSV > Packages** if you need to
verify the built-in apps are installed, then open **GSV > Integrations**.

If adapter Workers were not deployed yet, deploy them from the CLI:

```bash
gsv infra deploy -c channel-whatsapp
gsv infra deploy -c channel-discord --discord-bot-token "$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
```

Deploying everything with `gsv infra deploy --all` includes both adapter Workers.

## 2. Connect WhatsApp

In **GSV > Integrations**:

1. Select **WhatsApp**.
2. Use account id `primary` unless you need multiple WhatsApp accounts.
3. Click **Connect**. Enable the force/reconnect option if you are replacing an
   old pairing.
4. Scan the QR code with WhatsApp: Settings, Linked Devices, Link a Device.

The account should move to a connected status after pairing completes. Send a
test message to the linked WhatsApp account from another sender.

## 3. Connect Discord

Create a Discord bot in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Create an application and add a bot.
2. Copy the bot token.
3. Enable **Message Content Intent** when the bot needs to read message text.
4. Invite the bot to the server where you want to use it.

In **GSV > Integrations**:

1. Select **Discord**.
2. Use account id `main` unless you need multiple bot accounts.
3. Paste the bot token, or leave it blank if it was provided during deploy.
4. Click **Connect** and confirm the status becomes connected.

Mention the bot in a server channel or send it a direct message.

## 4. Link External Identities

GSV does not deliver unlinked external actors directly into a user's process.
The normal flow is:

1. Send a message from WhatsApp or Discord.
2. Copy the one-time link code returned by the adapter.
3. Open **GSV > Access**.
4. Redeem the code under **Identity links**.
5. Send another message from the external account.

Root users can also create links manually in the same **Access** section when
they know the adapter, account id, actor id, and target uid.

## 5. CLI Fallback

Use CLI adapter commands only when you want scripts or terminal diagnostics:

```bash
gsv adapter connect --adapter whatsapp --account-id primary --config-json '{"force":true}'
gsv adapter status --adapter whatsapp --account-id primary

gsv adapter connect --adapter discord --account-id main \
  --config-json '{"botToken":"<discord-bot-token>"}'
gsv adapter status --adapter discord --account-id main
```

Redeem a link code from the CLI if you are logged in as the target user:

```bash
gsv auth link CODE
```

## Troubleshooting

- If **GSV** is missing, run `gsv packages sync` from the CLI.
- If WhatsApp does not show a QR code, reconnect with the force option enabled.
- If Discord stays offline, check the bot token, invite permissions, Gateway
  status, and Message Content Intent.
- If messages are ignored, open **GSV > Access** and confirm the external actor is
  linked to the intended user.
